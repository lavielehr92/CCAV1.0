`scripts` package initializer.

This file makes the `scripts` directory importable as a Python package for
deployed environments (for example, Streamlit Cloud) that require package
modules to be discoverable via package imports like `from scripts.utils...`.

It intentionally exports no runtime objects; keep it minimal and import-safe.
